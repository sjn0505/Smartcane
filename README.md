# Smartcane
SmartCane device is an electronic travel aid which fits on the top fold of the white cane. 
It serves as an enhancement to the white cane and overcomes its limitations by detecting knee-above and hanging obstacles. 
Such objects include the side of a truck, hanging cloth strings, protruding coolers or air conditioners, railing, tree branches,
inclined ladders, etc. 
These obstacles do not have significant footprint on the ground and thus can result in injury to the head or upper body parts.
For safe mobility, it is important that they are detected early. 
The cane has other uses as a spatial awareness device as it can detect presence or absence of objects in the surroundings.
